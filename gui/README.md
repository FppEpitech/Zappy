# Zappy - GUI

Welcome to the GUI component of the Zappy project! This document will guide you through the setup, development, and contribution processes for the GUI part of the project.

## Table of Contents

## Project Overview

The Zappy project is a multiplayer, real-time strategy game developed as part of the Epitech Secondary year curriculum. The GUI component provides a graphical interface for players to interact with the game, visualize game states, and issue commands.

### Features

- Real-time updates of game state
- Interactive map and player controls
- Visualization of game statistics and resources

## Installation

To get started with the GUI, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/zappy.git
   cd Zappy/gui
```



<!-- # Zappy GUI

## **Build and Installation**

To build the Gui you must install the following [dependencies](#installing-raylib-on-fedora)

Then, at the root of the project run:

```bash
make
```

Or:

```bash
make re
```

Here the Gui's usages:

```
USAGE:	./zappy_gui -p port -h machine
```

To run the gui you have to enter the server's hostname and port.
Here an example with a server port **4242** and an hostname **127.0.0.1**:

```
./zappy_gui -p 4242 -h 127.0.0.1
```

## **Technology Notes**

The graphic part of Zappy was developed using C++.

The graphic library used in this project is [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/index.html) developped by Raysan5.

## Installing Raylib on Fedora

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have an up-to-date version of Fedora and that you have administrator privileges (sudo).

### Installation Steps

#### 1. Update Your System

Before installing new packages, it is recommended to update your system:

```bash
sudo dnf update
```
#### 2. Install Necessary Dependencies

Raylib requires certain libraries to function properly. Install them with the following command:

```bash
sudo dnf install alsa-lib-devel mesa-libGL-devel libX11-devel libXrandr-devel libXi-devel libXcursor-devel libXinerama-devel libatomic
```

Fedora offers Raylib directly in its repositories. You can install it using dnf:

```bash
sudo dnf install raylib-devel
```


**To make it easier, you can install everything in one command:**

```bash
make install-deps
```
#### 3. Verify the Installation
To ensure Raylib is installed correctly, you can compile and run a simple example. Create a file main.c with the include **raylib.h**.
To run the program, don't forget to use the flag **-lraylib**. -->
