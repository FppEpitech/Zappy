## Commit Conventions

We use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) commit conventions. This ensures a clear and meaningful commit history. [Other useful link](https://gist.github.com/qoomon/5dfcdf8eec66a051ecd85625518cfd13#file-conventional_commit_messages-md)

## Branch Naming

To maintain an organized repository, we have naming conventions for branches. Here are the branch types and their formats:

- **feature** : For new features -> `feat/<short description>`
- **bugfix** : For bug fixes -> `bugfix/<short description>`
- **hotfix** : For urgent fixes -> `hotfix/<short description>`
- **release** : For preparing a release -> `release/<version>`
- **documentation** : For adding or updating documentation -> `doc/<short description>`

Please adhere to these conventions to facilitate collaboration and project maintenance. Happy coding!
